# Urban Analytics in Philadelphia

This code provides instructions on how to get and clean the data for the paper "Spatial Modeling of Trends in Crime Over Time in Philadelphia", Balocchi and Jensen (2019). 

## The data

We acquire and clean:
- Demographic data:
  - total population
  - segregation
- Economic data:
  - income per capita
  - poverty
- Crime data:
  - violent crimes

These data are aggregated over block groups, and some things are specific to the city of Philadelphia.

Check 'get_data/readme.md' and 'get_data/data_collection.md' for details on where to download data, and the specific purpose of each script.
